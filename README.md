# Note-app-mern-stack

MY FIRST MERN-STACK APP!!! 

Although I have to scrupulously followed a 6-hour tutorial Youtube video in order to create this MASTERPIECE, I still feel proud about this achievemen. 

This is a Note-App that allows you to create note about the topics that you're about to learn, keep track of your learning progress, and reward yourself with some feeling of fulfillment when you can cross a note/goal off the list as completed. 

The login/register process should be straightforward, no need for your gmail, phone, or any personal info, just an username of your choice and password then you're good to go!
